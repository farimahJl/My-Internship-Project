 SG Papertronic company   has developed a device called Beer-o-Meter,  that allows brewers to analyze and measure whether their beer is of good quality or not. This helps them optimize their beer production and lower their cost. The problem is that the data collected by brewers need to be cleaned up and processed before it can be analyzed.
